Then, wash the horsegram thoroughly and soak it for at least 30 minutes. If you have the time, you can choose to soak it for an hour.",
      "Once the soaking is complete, drain the water from the horsegram and transfer it to a pressure cooker. Add a couple of tomatoes, 2 cups water to cook the horsegram, and a small amount of oil. Castor oil is recommended for achieving a soft and tender consistency, but if you don’t have it, you can omit it or use any vegetable oil of your preference. Cover the pressure cooker and cook for 12 minutes, disregarding the number of whistles. Afterward, remove the cooker from the heat and allow the pressure to settle naturally. Open the cooker and remove the tomatoes, discard the tomato skins, and set them aside. Drain the broth and also set it aside.",
      "Note",
      "The broth, tomatoes, and a small portion of the cooked horsegram will be used for making saaru/rasam, while the remaining cooked horsegram will be used for making sundal.",

Stir for a moment, and then add the chopped onions. Sauté for a few minutes until the onions are soft. Next, add the cooked horsegram, salt, and freshly shredded coconut. Mix everything together well and cook for a minute. Finally, sprinkle a generous amount of coriander leaves over the sundal to finish.",
      "For the saaru, heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds and chopped garlic. Add the curry leaves, dry red chillies, black pepper, and a small piece of tamarind. Roast briefly and then add a couple of tablespoons of the cooked horsegram to thicken the saaru. Add the cooked tomatoes (skin removed), a little coconut, turmeric powder, and some coriander leaves. Cook for a minute, then remove from heat and set it aside to cool. Grind this mixture with a little water to create a coarse paste, which will serve as our saaru masala.",
      "Now, let’s temper the rasam. Heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, curry leaves, and dried red chillies. Allow the mustard seeds to crackle. Add the horsegram broth and the ground masala paste. Rinse the mixie with 1.5 cups of water and add it to the pan. Season with salt, and taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Bring the saaru to a boil, and finish by sprinkling a generous amount of coriander leaves over it.",

      "Grease the idli plates with a small amount of oil and pour the idli batter into the moulds. Steam for 6-7 minutes until a knife inserted comes out clean. Remove the plates from heat and set them aside to cool. In a pan, heat vegetable oil and add urad dal, mustard seeds, cumin seeds, dried red chilies, ginger, curry leaves, and green chilies. Allow the mustard seeds to crackle, then roast for a few seconds. Add finely chopped onions and sauté for a few minutes until they turn soft. Sprinkle salt, turmeric powder, and asafoetida. Add the idlis and coriander leaves, and sauté for a few seconds to coat the idlis with the spices. Drizzle some ghee and squeeze lime juice over the mixture. Turn off the flame and mix well to combine. Avoid cooking for an extended period after adding lime juice, as it may result in a bitter taste. Enjoy your delicious lemon idlis!"
